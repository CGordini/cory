I will be creating new variations of this theme as sets of replacement SCSS files.

The first release in this series is today and it is called Midnight.

Noir is developed using and hosted with GitHub. You can head on over to the [repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) to download it, report any bugs, and to request features.

If you prefer to install the gem version of the theme you can do so [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/noir-for-jekyll).
